# GREVOS
GREVOS is a simple Python command line tool for generating graphs showing the **combined** activity of any number of GitHub repositories.

Live example available <a href="http://pferrot.github.io/grevos/drupal_20180412121215.html">here</a>.

GitHub activity graphs are nice, but large projects are often composed of more than one single git repository. GREVOS generates activity graphs for any number of repositories, thus allowing to see the pace of the entire project and who contributes.

## Features
* HTML and CSV outputs.
* Available statistics:
  * Number of commits
  * Additions
  * Deletions
  * Difference (= additions - deletions)
  * Total (= additions + deletions)
* All statistics can be enabled/disabled in the generated output.
* HTML output features:
  * Nice chart showing the progress of your projects.
  * Show total as well as per user contributions.
  * Access commit details on github.com by clicking a point in the graph.
* CSV output features:
  * Specify your preferred date format.
  * Show total as well as per user contributions.
  * Format makes it trivial to generate graph in Excel.
* Possibility to filter by user if you are only interested in the stats for a few users.
* Possibility to keep top contributors only.
* Possibility to map unknown authors to a given username when only email or name is available (but no login name).
* Possibility to limit commits to take into account based on the number of lines added - removed. Convenient to exclude commits that would otherwise bias the statistics (e.g when code formatting is applied or large files are copied into the project).
* Possibility to define `since` date. Convenient when working with very large repositories that contain a large number of commits over the years.
* Works with GitHub API. No need to clone the repositories locally.
* Cache mechanism to not have to fetch data from GitHub every time.
* Works with GitHub Enterprise.

## Prerequisites

Recommended: create a virtual env and install necessary dependencies:
```

Generate combined activity graphs for any number of repositories.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File containing the repos to process. Format: <scheme>
                        ,<host>,<base_path>,<org>,<repo>,<branch>,<commit_url_
                        pattern>,<since>,<api_token>[,<commits_to_ignore>].
                        <commits_to_ignore> is a - separated list of SHA

                        Outputs deletions in genereted files, default: yes.
  -odi [OUTPUT_DIFFERENCES], --output_differences [OUTPUT_DIFFERENCES]
                        Outputs differences (i.e. additions - deletions) in
                        genereted files, default: yes.
  -ot [OUTPUT_TOTALS], --output_totals [OUTPUT_TOTALS]
                        Outputs totals (i.e. additions + deletions) in
                        genereted files, default: yes.
  -d [CSV_DATE_FORMAT], --csv_date_format [CSV_DATE_FORMAT]
                        Date format in the generated CSV, default: '%m/%d/%Y
                        %H:%M:%S'.
  -eaf [EMAIL_TO_AUTHOR_FILE], --email_to_author_file [EMAIL_TO_AUTHOR_FILE]
                        File providing the mapping between email and username,
                        useful when the username is not available in the Git
                        commit but the email is. File format: one entry per
                        line, first item is the email, second item is the
                        username, separated by a comma.
  -naf [NAME_TO_AUTHOR_FILE], --name_to_author_file [NAME_TO_AUTHOR_FILE]
                        File providing the mapping between name and username,
                        useful when the username is not available in the Git
                        commit but the name is. File format: one entry per
                        line, first item is the name, second item is the

                        deletions) for it to be considered, default: no limit.
                        This is useful to exclude commits that do not make
                        sense to take into account because many files were
                        copied into the repository (e.g. JavaScript files in
                        node.js projects).
  -micd [MIN_COMMIT_DIFFERENCE], --min_commit_difference [MIN_COMMIT_DIFFERENCE]
                        Min difference of a commit (i.e. additions -
                        deletions) for it to be considered, default: no limit.
                        This is useful to exclude commits that do not make
                        sense to take into account because many files were
                        removed from the repository (e.g. JavaScript files in
                        node.js projects).
  -tc [TOP_CONTRIBUTORS], --top_contributors [TOP_CONTRIBUTORS]
                        Only keep the n top contributors based on the number
                        of (additions - deletions), default: keep all.
  -mph [MAX_POINTS_HTML], --max_points_html [MAX_POINTS_HTML]
                        Maximum number of points in the HTML output. A graph
                        with too many points will not offer a good user
                        experience.

Then run with the desired parameters, e.g.:

```
python3 grevos.py \
-oc yes -oa yes -od yes -odi yes -ot yes \
-tc 5 -macd 5000 -micd -5000 -mph 500 \
-f drupal.csv
```

And then wait until all commits have been processed. Note that the first time you generate a graph for a given repository, it might take some time as the data must be retrieved from GitHub. Supsequent executions will be much faster thanks to the necessary data being cached locally.
